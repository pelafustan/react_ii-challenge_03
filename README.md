# React II

## Challenge 03

### Context

We were asked to develop an app that uses the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), so we can show our skills when using `react-router`

You can check this terrific piece of code [here.](https://pelafustan.github.io/react_ii-challenge_03/)

I'm too lazy to elaborate what's going on here, but you can always check the source code, is free!
